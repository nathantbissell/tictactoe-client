This is a traditional game of Tic Tac Toe, where a user will have to sign into the server before playing a game.

If you do not already have an account, you can sign up with one by providing your email address, a password, and confirming the password in a second field.

After logging in, users will have to click the "Create Game" button, and then the game board will appear. Once the board appears, X always goes first. Users will be able to place "X" and "O"s on the board until a tie occurs, or a winner has been determined

If a user has signed in, they have the option of resetting their password. They will have to enter the old password, followed by the new password to confirm.

Users will be able to click the "reset" button at the bottom of the screen at any point to clear the game board.

Users will be able to sign out of their account at any point, but by doing so they will lose the progress on any non completed games.

Users will also be able to view how mnay games they have played on an account by clicking the "Previous Games" button.
